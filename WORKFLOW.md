## Task: Scripts Project Setup with uv

**Status:** ✅ Completed
**Date:** 2025-11-07 (Current)

### Objective:
Reorganize the crawler script into a separate uv-managed Python project with proper dependency management and isolation from the Shopify theme.

### Tasks Completed:

1. ✅ **Created Scripts Project Directory**
   - Created `scripts/` directory as a standalone Python project
   - Initialized with `uv init --name crawler --lib`

2. ✅ **Moved Crawler Files to Scripts Directory**
   - Moved `crawler.py` → `scripts/crawler.py`
   - Moved `crawl_db.yaml` → `scripts/crawl_db.yaml`
   - Moved `CRAWLER_README.md` → `scripts/README_CRAWLER.md`

3. ✅ **Configured uv Project** - `scripts/pyproject.toml`
   - Added dependencies: requests, pyyaml, beautifulsoup4
   - Added project metadata and description
   - Configured script entry point

4. ✅ **Installed Dependencies with uv**
   - Ran `uv sync` to create virtual environment
   - All dependencies installed successfully in `.venv/`

5. ✅ **Created Local Instructions** - `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
   - Detailed project structure explanation
   - uv usage instructions
   - Clear separation between theme and scripts
   - Quick reference commands table

6. ✅ **Updated PROJECT.md**
   - Replaced old crawler section with Scripts Project section
   - Documented uv-based workflow
   - Explained separation rationale
   - Updated file locations

### Project Structure After Reorganization:

```
islamabad/
├── .claude/
│   └── CLAUDE.md          # Local project instructions
├── scripts/               # Separate uv-managed Python project
│   ├── .venv/            # Virtual environment (managed by uv)
│   ├── pyproject.toml    # uv project configuration
│   ├── crawler.py        # Web crawler script
│   ├── crawl_db.yaml     # Crawler database
│   ├── downloads/        # Downloaded files
│   └── README_CRAWLER.md # Crawler documentation
├── assets/               # Shopify theme assets
├── blocks/               # Shopify theme blocks
├── config/               # Shopify theme config
└── [other theme files]   # Shopify theme structure
```

### Benefits of This Setup:

1. **Clean Separation**: Theme and scripts are completely isolated
2. **Modern Tooling**: uv provides fast, reliable dependency management
3. **Easy to Use**: Single command `uv run crawler.py` handles everything
4. **Reproducible**: Lock file ensures consistent environments
5. **Maintainable**: Each component has its own dependencies and configuration

### Usage:

```bash
# Run crawler with uv (recommended)
cd scripts/
uv run crawler.py --status

# Or activate virtual environment
cd scripts/
source .venv/bin/activate
python crawler.py --status
```

### Files Modified/Created:

- Created: `scripts/pyproject.toml`
- Created: `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- Modified: `PROJECT.md` (updated crawler section)
- Moved: `crawler.py`, `crawl_db.yaml`, `CRAWLER_README.md` to `scripts/`
- Created: `scripts/.venv/` (virtual environment)

## Task: Product Images Troubleshooting

**Status:** 🔍 Diagnosed
**Date:** 2025-11-10

### Issue:
User reported that product images are not displaying in the product card gallery. Instead, they see `product-card-gallery__title-placeholder` text.

### Root Cause Identified:

**The problem is NOT with the theme code - the Shopify products have NO IMAGES attached to them.**

#### Analysis:
1. **Theme Code is Working Correctly**: `snippets/card-gallery.liquid:216-226`
   - When `product.media.size == 0`, the theme displays a placeholder
   - This is expected behavior for products without images

2. **Product Status Check**:
   - Created diagnostic script: `scripts/check_product_images.py`
   - Ran verification against store: `xjtm5x-pp.myshopify.com`
   - **Result**: 1 product found ("Son Hi-Fi") with **ZERO images**

```
Store: xjtm5x-pp.myshopify.com
Total products: 1
✗ Without images: 1

Product: Son Hi-Fi (Handle: son-hi-fi)
Images: ✗ NO IMAGES
```

### Solution Options:

#### Option 1: Manual Upload (Immediate)
1. Go to Shopify Admin: https://xjtm5x-pp.myshopify.com/admin/products/15737120162141
2. Edit product "Son Hi-Fi"
3. Upload product images manually

#### Option 2: Automated Import (Requires Setup)
1. Add image URLs to product catalog: `scripts/shopify/products-dali-catalog.yaml`
2. Run image import script:
   ```bash
   cd scripts/
   uv run shopify/products/add_product_images.py
   ```

### Files Created:
- `scripts/check_product_images.py` - Diagnostic tool to check all products for images

### Current Store Status:
- **Store**: xjtm5x-pp.myshopify.com
- **Products**: 1 product
- **Products with images**: 0
- **Products without images**: 1 (Son Hi-Fi)

### Next Steps:
1. User needs to add images to the "Son Hi-Fi" product
2. Once images are added, the product cards will display them automatically
3. No theme code changes required

## Task: Predictive Search Results Background Fix

**Status:** ✅ Fixed
**Date:** 2025-11-10

### Issue:
Predictive search results section (`predictive-search-results__products`) had no background, making product results unreadable when overlaying background images. The "Produits" section and product cards were barely visible.

### Root Cause:
The `.predictive-search-results__inner` element in `snippets/predictive-search.liquid:256-268` had no background color set, causing it to be completely transparent and overlay the page background.

### Solution Applied:
Added semi-transparent background with blur effect to `.predictive-search-results__inner`:

```css
background-color: rgba(var(--color-background-rgb), 0.95);
backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
```

This provides:
- **95% opacity** background using the theme's background color
- **Blur effect** (10px) for modern glassmorphism look
- **Readable text** on any background
- **Maintains theme consistency** by using CSS variables

### Files Modified:
- `snippets/predictive-search.liquid:266-267` - Added background and backdrop-filter

### Result:
- Search results now have a light, semi-transparent background
- Text is fully readable regardless of page background
- Maintains visual elegance with blur effect
- Uses theme color variables for consistency
